# Memory Match Game (Unity)

A polished memory-matching game built entirely from scratch using **Unity 2021 LTS**.  
The game includes smooth animations, a scoring system, save/load functionality, and simple sound effects.  
This project was developed under strict conditions: no third-party assets, meaningful Git commits, and mobile/desktop compatibility.
